Howdy! I'm Earth! I'm a silly goofball who's having fun studying how to code. ^^

I'm a student studying Computer Science. My main programming language are C++ and JS. But I'm trying to learn more languages, too! ^^
If you'd like, you could friend me on Discord (@earthteardrop) if you wanted to help me in my coding journey! ^^

Well, that's all. Bye! ^^
